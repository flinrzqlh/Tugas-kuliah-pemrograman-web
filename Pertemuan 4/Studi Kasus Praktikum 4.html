	<div class= "text" id="roundBorder">
		This is The Circle Paragraph. The words that you are reading right 
		now are all contained within this perfectly round border. 
		Pretty cool, right? </div>
	<div class="text" id="curvedBorder">
		This is The Rectangle Paragraph with curves on it's top left side 
		and it's bottom right side. Looks really stylish and sharp. 
		So sleek looking. I like it. </div>
	<div class= "text" id="floatingBorder">
		This is The Floating Rectangle Paragraph. 
		The words are all contained in this seemingly floating rectangle. 
		How is this possible? Well, we use the "box shadow" properti in css. 
		It will make your border float like this! </div>
